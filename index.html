			<p>Kendrick Lamar was just coming off of his breakout album in the industry "Good Kid M.a.a.d City", the public was still unsure about what Kendrick could be as an artist and were anticipating a new album. Kendrick had an album ready but scrapped what he had after a fateful trip to Africa which really changed his perspective. He began making an album in honor of his favourite rapper Tupac Shakur, and recites a poem to him throughout the album which progresses the story of his album. The album talks about Kendrick's struggles with staying true to who he is with the temptations of fame, focusing on the two villains of the piece "Uncle Sam" which represents the US taking advantage of black people and "Lucy" or Lucifer the devil herself</p>

			<p>To Pimp a Butterfly is a 16 song story about race relations in the US, learning how to cope with fame, staying true to yourself, and learning to love and accept who you are. It is handled beautifully over a jazz/rap blend of production that really switches up teh typical sound of hip-hop. Every song is told beautifully and follows a story clearly outlined by Kendrick Lamar's beautiful storytelling and lyricism. There are so many hidden meanings or just perfect placement of sounds and phrases. The album starts with Kendrick high off of the success of his career with songs like "Wesley's Theroy" and "For Free?" and eventually shows his dip into depression after he finds out that one of his best friends little brother died, who he was supposed to protect as a request from his freind who is in prison. Kendrick didn't even make it to the sugery room as he was on tour, his dissapointment is outlined on a peak of the album "u", and that is just a taste of the storytelling on this album.</p>

			<p>This project was Kendrick's "we'll see" project as the public wasn't sure who he could be in the industry yet, he was the guy with one good album but NOW he was solidifed. This album is revered by many as the best album of all time and considered a benchmark in music history. It is in the #1 consideration of every list or ranking of the last 10 years and is an undeniable hip-hop classic. In one of the biggest snubs of modern music awards history Kendrick lost the ALbum of the Year to Taylor Swift's "1989", but Kendrick did recieve 11 nominations in 2016, the most for any rapper in a single show. "Alright" won "Best Rap Song" and "Best Rap Performance", "These Walls" also won "Best Rap/Sung Performance. As you can see this heavily decorated project is undeniably the BEST rap album of the 2010's and possibly of all time.</p>
