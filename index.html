			<p>Kanye West has by far the most impressive rap album in the 2010s. After his infamous scene at the 2009 VMAS with Taylor Swift, the world had shunned Kanye West and he went to work to make the most undeniable masterpiece of his career. He took a trip to Hawaii and started "Rap Camp", flying out artists and producers to help him as he worked nonstop on this album. What we got from Kanye was exactly what he wanted, everything good about Kanye West in one concise project with no weak points.</p>
			
			<p>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is an incredible album about Kanye's struggles with fame and being in the public eye handled with beautiful beats, lyrics, and features all over the album. The peak of the album "Runaway" is an incredible almost apology letter to the public with a great beat, a great feature from Pusha T, and probably my favourite individual piece of music in the runaway outro. There are no weak points on this album and it features a song for every mood and everys song has a different meaning behind it. That's not to mention the all-star cast Kanye assembled for this project. Kid Cudi, Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross, Pusha T, Rihanna, Elton John, and Jay-Z just to name a few.</p>

			<p>Kanye wasn't sure about how the public was going to recieve this album as it was kind of a coin-flip to see if he could win back the admiration of the public. The project is revered by many as Kanye's best album to date and considered a classic album in rap and just generally in music. The album appears on nearly every end-of-decade ranking list you can find, whether its top 50, 100, 200 or even 500 it has a quality spot. In 2012 it won the grammy award for "Best Rap Album", a title song "All of the Lights" also won "Best Rap Song" & "Best Rap/Sung Collaboration". As you can see this heavily decorated and well-received album should be YOUR #1 album of the 2010s</p>
